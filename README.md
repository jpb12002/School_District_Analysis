# PyCitySchools with Pandas

## Overview of the School District Analysis
Maria, a school disctrict data scientist, requested our help to gather all standardized test data in the district for analysis. We needed to aggregate the raw data about student test scores, school spending, school size, and school type to show trends in school performance. This analysis will be used by the school board to make decisions about future school budget allotments. However, after our initial analysis was delivered, the school board noticed academic dishonesty within the ninth grade test scores at Thomas High School. We were then tasked with replacing the ninth grade scores at Thomas High School with "NaN's" while not affecting the rest of the data. The school district analysis was then be repeated and any changes in the analysis were described.
